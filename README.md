We develop tools related to government transparency and for the public good. We implement ETL and data standards to facilitate many data sources correlation so that timely research can be turned into action. Our goal is to apply the tools and implementation to make data accessible from local, regional, and national sources.

For example, the California DOGE codebase is both for California State government data research and as a template for other states to follow. Code is publicly licensed as Apache 2.0 and CC-BY. We can help you organize your team and start your own DOGE related site. We aspire to compliment [Data Republican](https://datarepublican.com) and [Federal DOGE](https://doge.gov).

Star and share these projects with your networks, so we can get some developers from other areas to contribute and maybe create their own DOGE projects.

Follow the organization and star the repositories to get notified of changes. You can also follow on twitter https://x.com/cali_doge.

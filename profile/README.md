I have created the DOGE Network organization at github.com/DOGE-network. 

The California DOGE codebase is both for California State government data research and as a template for other states to follow. Code is publicly licensed as Apache 2.0 and CC-BY. 

Share with your networks, so we can get some developers from other states to create their own DOGE sites starting from the template.

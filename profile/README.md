We individually are supporting various projects related to government transparency. While these are generally passion projects that we would do for free, it would be nice to get collaboration across many similar projects to help push forward.

For example, the California DOGE codebase is both for California State government data research and as a template for other states to follow. Code is publicly licensed as Apache 2.0 and CC-BY. 

Star and share these projects with your networks, so we can get some developers from other areas to contribute and maybe create their own DOGE projects.

Follow the organization and star the repositories to get notified of changes. You can also follow on twitter [https://x.com/cali_doge](https://x.com/cali_doge).

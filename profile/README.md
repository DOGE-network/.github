I have created the DOGE Network organization at github.com/DOGE-network. 

The California DOGE codebase is both for California State government data research and as a template for other states to follow. Code is publicly licensed as Apache 2.0 and CC-BY. 

Share with your networks, so we can get some developers from other states to create their own DOGE sites starting from the template.

Follow the organization and star the repositories to get notified of changes. You can also follow on twitter [https://x.com/cali_doge](https://x.com/cali_doge).
